## 🚀 Why UBT?

Traditional analytics tell you **what** happened (e.g., "Bounce Rate: 60%"). OmniView tells you **why**.

By reconstructing the DOM (Document Object Model) rather than recording actual video, we provide pixel-perfect session replays with zero performance impact on your app.

> *"If a picture is worth a thousand words, a session replay is worth a thousand charts."*
